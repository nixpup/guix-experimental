# Information
This Guix configuration has *not* been tested yet, so take whatever you see here with a grain of salt. The configuration/setup included all necessary packages, sets up the **nonguix** channel, symlinks configuration files via **Guix Home**, installs Nvidia Drivers, and compiles the [NaitreHUD](https://github.com/nixpup/NaitreHUD) Wayland Window Manager and Compositor.
